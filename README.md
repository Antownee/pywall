Simple web crawler made within Python and utilising Scrapy. I used it to download wallpapers from http://visualstudiowallpapers.com programmatically. The long method would've sucked. (Even though writing this crawler took quite a while to write)

Heavily adapted from Scrapy's official documentation: http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html

Also, my first commit :D
